# Personal MacBook Stash

This repository serves as a centralized hub for organizing and version controlling my various scripts, configurations, and files scattered across my personal system(s).

By consolidating these resources, I aim to improve maintainability and track changes to these files. Also, I'm forcing myself to keep them maintained, at least to a minimum.

Please be aware that these **are still personal** and are not meant to exactly match your preferences or needs, but they still **might be of use to someone**.

That is also the reason I'm open-sourcing these as well, because why not.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Contents

## The repository is structured as follows:

- `/brew`: Mostly documentation on certain aspects of brew/brew packages.

- `/docker-compose`: General-use Docker Compose setups. Can be reused and edited as needed for different purposes.

- `/kube`: Some Kubernetes-related scripts.

- `/scripts`: A stash of Bash scripts.

- `/startup`: A script that will install a startup script in `~/.macbook-stash` and a plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Feel free to explore and use the repository.

Your input is valuable, and improvements or additional resources are always welcome. If you identify areas for improvement or have suggestions, please create a GitHub issue.
